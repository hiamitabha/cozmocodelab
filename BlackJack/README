 A simple program in Anki Cozmo Code Labs Constructor mode to play the game of
 blackjack, with Cozmo playing the role of the dealer.

 Please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack for a history of
 Blackjack and the most common rules that the game is played with.

 This version supports all the rules played in US casinos except the split
 hand.

 The program is designed to play for a best of 5 games, but that can be
 changed easily in the program.

 Otherwise, the rules are simple. Tap the blue cube to start a game, then tap
 a green cube to draw an additional card, else tap the red cube to stop.
 Unless you have busted your hand, Cozmo will take turns after you.

 Hope you enjoy the game. As usual, please keep the feedback coming. Thanks.
